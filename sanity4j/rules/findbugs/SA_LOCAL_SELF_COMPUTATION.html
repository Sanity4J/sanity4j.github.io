<H2>SA: Nonsensical self computation involving a variable (e.g., x & x) (SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPUTATION)</H2>
<p> This method performs a nonsensical computation of a local variable with another
reference to the same variable (e.g., x&x or x-x). Because of the nature
of the computation, this operation doesn't seem to make sense,
and may indicate a typo or
a logic error.  Double check the computation.
