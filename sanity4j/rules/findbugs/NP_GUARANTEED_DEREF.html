<h3>NP: Null value is guaranteed to be dereferenced (NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF)</h3>
<p>
There is a statement or branch that if executed guarantees that
a value is null at this point, and that
value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced
(except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions).
</p>
<p>Note that a check such as
<code>if (x == null) throw new NullPointerException();</code>
is treated as a dereference of <code>x</code>.</p>
