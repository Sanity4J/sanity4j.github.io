<H2>Ru: Invokes run on a thread (did you mean to start it instead?) (RU_INVOKE_RUN)</H2>
<p> This method explicitly invokes <code>run()</code> on an object.&nbsp;
  In general, classes implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface because
  they are going to have their <code>run()</code> method invoked in a new thread,
  in which case <code>Thread.start()</code> is the right method to call.</p>
