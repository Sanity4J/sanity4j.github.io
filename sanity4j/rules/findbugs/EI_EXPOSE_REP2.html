<H2>EI2: May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable object (EI_EXPOSE_REP2)</H2>
<p> This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the
  internal representation of the object.&nbsp;
   If instances
   are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to
   the mutable object would compromise security or other
   important properties, you will need to do something different.
  Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.</p>
