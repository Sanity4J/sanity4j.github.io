<H2>STI: Static Thread.interrupted() method invoked on thread instance (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREAD)</H2>
<p>
This method invokes the Thread.interrupted() method on a Thread object that appears to be a Thread object that is
not the current thread. As the interrupted() method is static, the interrupted method will be called on a different
object than the one the author intended.
