<H2>UL: Method does not release lock on all paths (UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK)</H2>
<p> This method acquires a JSR-166 (<code>java.util.concurrent</code>) lock,
but does not release it on all paths out of the method.  In general, the correct idiom
for using a JSR-166 lock is:
</p>
<pre>
    Lock l = ...;
    l.lock();
    try {
        // do something
    } finally {
        l.unlock();
    }
</pre>
