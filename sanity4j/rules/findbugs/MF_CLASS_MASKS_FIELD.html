<H2>MF: Class defines field that masks a superclass field (MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD)</H2>
<p> This class defines a field with the same name as a visible
instance field in a superclass.  This is confusing, and
may indicate an error if methods update or access one of
the fields when they wanted the other.</p>
