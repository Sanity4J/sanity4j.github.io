<h3>NP: Possible null pointer dereference on branch that might be infeasible (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLE)</h3>
<p> There is a branch of statement that, <em>if executed,</em>  guarantees that
a null value will be dereferenced, which
would generate a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed.
Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that
the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs.
Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness,
this is a definite possibility.
