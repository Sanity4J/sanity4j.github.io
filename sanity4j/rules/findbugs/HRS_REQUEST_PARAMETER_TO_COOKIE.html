<H2>HRS: HTTP cookie formed from untrusted input (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_COOKIE)</H2>
<p>This code constructs an HTTP Cookie using an untrusted HTTP parameter. If this cookie is added to an HTTP response, it will allow a HTTP response splitting
vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>FindBugs looks only for the most blatent, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting.
If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almostly certainly</em> have more 
vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriously 
consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool, such as those provided by <a href="http://www.fortify.com/">Fortify Software</a>,
a sponsor of the FindBugs project. If your software is open source, Fortify will scan your code for free
as part of the <a href="http://opensource.fortifysoftware.com/welcome.html">JOR (Java Open Review)</a> effort.
