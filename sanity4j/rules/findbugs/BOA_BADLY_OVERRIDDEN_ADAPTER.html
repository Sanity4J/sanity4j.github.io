<h3>BOA: Class overrides a method implemented in super class Adapter wrongly (BOA_BADLY_OVERRIDDEN_ADAPTER)</h3>
<p> This method overrides a method found in a parent class, where that class is an Adapter that implements
a listener defined in the java.awt.event or javax.swing.event package. As a result, this method will not
get called when the event occurs.</p>
