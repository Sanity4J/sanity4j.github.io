<h3>FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)</h3>
<p>
A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments.
However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but
does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}).  It is likely
that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string
is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored
and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting.
