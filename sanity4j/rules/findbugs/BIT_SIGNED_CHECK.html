<h3>BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK)</h3>
<p> This method compares an expression such as</p>
<pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>.
<p>Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can
lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of
SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate
for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice
to use '!= 0' instead of '&gt; 0'.
