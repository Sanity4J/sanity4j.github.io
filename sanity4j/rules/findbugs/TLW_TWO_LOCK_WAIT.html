<H2>TLW: Wait with two locks held (TLW_TWO_LOCK_WAIT)</H2>
<p> Waiting on a monitor while two locks are held may cause
  deadlock.
   &nbsp;
   Performing a wait only releases the lock on the object
   being waited on, not any other locks.
   &nbsp;
This not necessarily a bug, but is worth examining
  closely.</p>
