<H2>DP: Classloaders should only be created inside doPrivileged block (DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</H2>
<p> This code creates a classloader,  which requires a security manager.
  If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not
  have security permissions, then the classloader creation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.</p>
