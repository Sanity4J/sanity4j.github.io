<h3>DP: Classloaders should only be created inside doPrivileged block (DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</h3>
<p> This code creates a classloader,  which needs permission if a security manage is installed.
  If this code might be invoked by code that does not
  have security permissions, then the classloader creation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.</p>
