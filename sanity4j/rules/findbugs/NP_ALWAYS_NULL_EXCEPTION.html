<H2>NP: Null pointer dereference in method on exception path (NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTION)</H2>
<p> A pointer which is null on an exception path is dereferenced here.&nbsp;
This will lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed.&nbsp;
Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths,
this may be a false warning.</p>

<p> Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to
be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.</p>
