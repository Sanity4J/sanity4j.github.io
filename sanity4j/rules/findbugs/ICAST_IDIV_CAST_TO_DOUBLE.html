<H2>ICAST: int division result cast to double or float (ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE)</H2>
<p>
This code casts the result of an integer division operation to double or 
float.
Doing division on integers truncates the result
to the integer value closest to zero.  The fact that the result
was cast to double suggests that this precision should have been retained.
What was probably meant was to cast one or both of the operands to
double <em>before</em> performing the division.  Here is an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
int x = 2;
int y = 5;
// Wrong: yields result 0.0
double value1 =  x / y;

// Right: yields result 0.4
double value2 =  x / (double) y;
</pre>
