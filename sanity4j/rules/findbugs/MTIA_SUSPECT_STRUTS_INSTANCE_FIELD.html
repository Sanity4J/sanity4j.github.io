<H2>MTIA: Class extends Struts Action class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELD)</H2>
<p>
    This class extends from a Struts Action class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only
    one instance of a struts Action class is created by the Struts framework, and used in a
    multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider
    only using method local variables. Only instance fields that are written outside of a monitor
    are reported.
