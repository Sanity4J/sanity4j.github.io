<H2>Wa: Condition.await() not in loop  (WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP)</H2>
<p> This method contains a call to <code>java.util.concurrent.await()</code>
   (or variants)
  which is not in a loop.&nbsp; If the object is used for multiple conditions,
  the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one
  that actually occurred.</p>
