<h3>Nm: Apparent method/constructor confusion (NM_METHOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CONFUSION)</h3>
<p> This regular method has the same name as the class it is defined in. It is likely that this was intended to be a constructor.
      If it was intended to be a constructor, remove the declaration of a void return value.
    If you had accidentally defined this method, realized the mistake, defined a proper constructor
    but can't get rid of this method due to backwards compatibility, deprecate the method.
