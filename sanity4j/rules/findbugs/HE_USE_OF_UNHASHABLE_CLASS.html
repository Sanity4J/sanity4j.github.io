<H2>HE: Use of class without a hashCode() method in a hashed data structure (HE_USE_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS)</H2>
<p> A class defines an equals(Object)  method but not a hashCode() method,
and thus doesn't fulfill the requirement that equal Objects have equal hashCodes.
An instance of this class is used in a hash data structure, making the need to
fix this problem of highest importance.
