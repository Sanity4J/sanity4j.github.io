<h3>DP: Method invoked that should be only be invoked inside a doPrivileged block (DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</h3>
<p> This code invokes a method that requires a security permission check.
  If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not
  have security permissions, then the invocation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.</p>
