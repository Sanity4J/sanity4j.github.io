<h3>IJU: JUnit assertion in run method will not be noticed by JUnit (IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHOD)</h3>
<p> A JUnit assertion is performed in a run method. Failed JUnit assertions
just result in exceptions being thrown.
Thus, if this exception occurs in a thread other than the thread that invokes
the test method, the exception will terminate the thread but not result
in the test failing.
