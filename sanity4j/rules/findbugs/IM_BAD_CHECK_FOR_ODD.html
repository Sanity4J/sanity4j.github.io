<h3>IM: Check for oddness that won't work for negative numbers  (IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD)</h3>
<p>
The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work
for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check
for oddness, consider using x &amp; 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.
