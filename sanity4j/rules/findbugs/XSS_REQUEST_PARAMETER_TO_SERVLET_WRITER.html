<H2>XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER)</H2>
<p>This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to Servlet output, which allows for a reflected cross site scripting
vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>FindBugs looks only for the most blatent, obvious cases of cross site scripting.
If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almostly certainly</em> have more cross site scripting
vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously 
consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool, such as those provided by <a href="http://www.fortify.com/">Fortify Software</a>,
a sponsor of the FindBugs project. If your software is open source, Fortify will scan your code for free
as part of the <a href="http://opensource.fortifysoftware.com/welcome.html">JOR (Java Open Review)</a> effort.
