<h3>Se: Method must be private in order for serialization to work (SE_METHOD_MUST_BE_PRIVATE)</h3>
<p> This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, and defines a method
  for custom serialization/deserialization. But since that method isn't declared private,
  it will be silently ignored by the serialization/deserialization API.</p>
