<H2>MSF: Mutable servlet field (MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD)</H2>
<p>A web server generally only creates one instance of servlet or jsp class (i.e., treates
the class as a Singleton), 
and will 
have multiple threads invoke methods on that instance to service multiple 
simultaneous requests.
Thus, having a mutable instance field generally creates race conditions.
