<H2>Se: Transient field of class that isn't Serializable.  (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS)</H2>
<p> The field is marked as transient, but the class isn't Serializable, so marking it as transient
has absolutely no effect. 
This may be leftover marking from a previous version of the code in which the class was transient, or
it may indicate a misunderstanding of how serialization works.
