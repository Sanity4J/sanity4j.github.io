<H2>RV: Random value from 0 to 1 is coerced to the integer 0 (RV_01_TO_INT)</H2>
<p>A random value from 0 to 1 is being coerced to the integer value 0. You probably
want to multiple the random value by something else before coercing it to an integer, or use the <code>Random.nextInt(n)</code> method.
