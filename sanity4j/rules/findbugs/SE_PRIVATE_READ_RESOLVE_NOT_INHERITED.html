<H2>Se: private readResolve method not inherited by subclasses (SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED)</H2>
<p> This class defines a private readResolve method. Since it is private, it won't be inherited by subclasses.
This might be intentional and OK, but should be reviewed to ensure it is what is intended.
