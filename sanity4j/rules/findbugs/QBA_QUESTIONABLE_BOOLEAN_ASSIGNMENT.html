<H2>QBA: Method assigns boolean literal in boolean expression (QBA_QUESTIONABLE_BOOLEAN_ASSIGNMENT)</H2>
<p>
      This method assigns a literal boolean value (true or false) to a boolean variable inside
      an if or while expression. Most probably this was supposed to be a boolean comparison using 
      ==, not an assignment using =.
