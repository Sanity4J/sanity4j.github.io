<H2>MS: May expose internal static state by storing a mutable object into a static field (EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2)</H2>
<p> This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into a static
   field.
   If unchecked changes to
   the mutable object would compromise security or other
   important properties, you will need to do something different.
  Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.</p>
