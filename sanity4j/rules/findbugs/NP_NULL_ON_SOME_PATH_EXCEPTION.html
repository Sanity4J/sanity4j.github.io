<H2>NP: Possible null pointer dereference in method on exception path (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTION)</H2>
<p> A reference value which is null on some exception control path is
dereferenced here.&nbsp; This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code>
when the code is executed.&nbsp;
Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths,
this may be a false warning.</p>

<p> Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to
be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.</p>
