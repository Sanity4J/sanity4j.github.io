<h3>LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)</h3>
<p> This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field.
Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions,
threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object,
<em>if the method can be called by multiple threads</em>.
You can make the field volatile to correct the problem.
