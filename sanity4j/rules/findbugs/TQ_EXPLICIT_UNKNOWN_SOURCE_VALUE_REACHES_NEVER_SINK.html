<H2>TQ: Explicit annotation inconsistent with use (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)</H2>
<p>
      A value is used in a way that requires it to be never be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but
	there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is prohibited from having that type qualifier.
	Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect.
