<h3>RS: Class's readObject() method is synchronized (RS_READOBJECT_SYNC)</h3>
<p> This serializable class defines a <code>readObject()</code> which is
  synchronized.&nbsp; By definition, an object created by deserialization
  is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for
  <code>readObject()</code> to be synchronized.&nbsp; If the <code>readObject()</code>
  method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread,
  that is an example of very dubious coding style.</p>
