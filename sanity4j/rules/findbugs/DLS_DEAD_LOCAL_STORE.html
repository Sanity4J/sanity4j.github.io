<H2>DLS: Dead store to local variable (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE)</H2>
<p>
This instruction assigns a value to a local variable,
but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction.
Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never
used.
</p>
<p>
Note that Sun's javac compiler often generates dead stores for
final local variables.  Because FindBugs is a bytecode-based tool,
there is no easy way to eliminate these false positives.
