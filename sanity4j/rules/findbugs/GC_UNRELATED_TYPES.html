<H2>GC: No relationship between generic parameter and method argument (GC_UNRELATED_TYPES)</H2>
<p> This call to a generic container's method contains an argument
     with a different class type from that of the container's parameter. 
     Therefore, it is unlikely that the container contains any objects 
     with the same type as the method argument used here.
