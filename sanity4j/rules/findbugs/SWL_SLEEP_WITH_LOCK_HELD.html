<H2>SWL: Method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held (SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD)</H2>
<p>
      This method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held.  This may result
      in very poor performance and scalability, or a deadlock, since other threads may
      be waiting to acquire the lock.  It is a much better idea to call
      wait() on the lock, which releases the lock and allows other threads
      to run.
