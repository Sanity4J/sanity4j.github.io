<h3>SWL: Method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held (SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD)</h3>
<p>
This method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held.  This may result
in very poor performance and scalability, or a deadlock, since other threads may
be waiting to acquire the lock.  It is a much better idea to call
wait() on the lock, which releases the lock and allows other threads
to run.
