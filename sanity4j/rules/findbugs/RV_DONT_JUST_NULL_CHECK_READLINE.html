<H2>RV: Method discards result of readLine after checking if it is nonnull (RV_DONT_JUST_NULL_CHECK_READLINE)</H2>
<p> The value returned by readLine is discarded after checking to see if the return
value is non-null. In almost all situations, if the result is non-null, you will want
to use that non-null value. Calling readLine again will give you a different line.</p>
