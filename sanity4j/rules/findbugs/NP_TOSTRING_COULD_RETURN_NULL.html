<H2>NP: toString method may return null (NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULL)</H2>
<p>
	This toString method seems to return null in some circumstances. A liberal reading of the
	spec could be interpreted as allowing this, but it is probably a bad idea and could cause
	other code to break. Return the empty string or some other appropriate string rather than null.
