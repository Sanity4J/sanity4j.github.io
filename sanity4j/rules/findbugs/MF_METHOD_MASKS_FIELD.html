<h3>MF: Method defines a variable that obscures a field (MF_METHOD_MASKS_FIELD)</h3>
<p> This method defines a local variable with the same name as a field
in this class or a superclass.  This may cause the method to
read an uninitialized value from the field, leave the field uninitialized,
or both.</p>
