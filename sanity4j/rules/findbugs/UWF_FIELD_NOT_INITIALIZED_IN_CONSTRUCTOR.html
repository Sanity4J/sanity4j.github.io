<H2>UwF: Field not initialized in constructor (UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR)</H2>
<p> This field is never initialized within any constructor, and is therefore could be null after
the object is constructed.
This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since
it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced
before being initialized.
