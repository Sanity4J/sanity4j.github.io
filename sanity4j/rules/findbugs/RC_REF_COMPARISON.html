<H2>RC: Suspicious reference comparison (RC_REF_COMPARISON)</H2>
<p> This method compares two reference values using the == or != operator,
where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally
with the equals() method.  Examples of classes which should generally
not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.</p>
