<h3><a name="JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER">JLM: Synchronization performed on util.concurrent instance (JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER)</h3>
<p> This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of
a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances
of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to
the synchronization provided by the Java keyword <code>synchronized</code>. For example,
synchronizing on an <code>AtomicBoolean</code> will not prevent other threads
from modifying the  <code>AtomicBoolean</code>.</p>
<p>Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented,
and may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.
