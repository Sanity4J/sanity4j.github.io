<h3>MS: Field should be both final and package protected (MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT)</h3>
<p>
   A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or
        by accident from another package.
        The field could be made package protected and/or made final
   to avoid
        this vulnerability.</p>
