<H2>ML: Synchronization on field in futile attempt to guard that field (ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD)</H2>
<p> This method synchronizes on a field in what appears to be an attempt
to guard against simultaneous updates to that field. But guarding a field
gets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not 
provide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might 
be obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes). An example
of this pattern would be:

<p><pre>
private Long myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(0);
private Long getNotificationSequenceNumber() {
     Long result = null;
     synchronized(myNtfSeqNbrCounter) {
         result = new Long(myNtfSeqNbrCounter.longValue() + 1);
         myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(result.longValue());
     }
     return result;
 }
</pre>
