<h3>BC: Impossible downcast of toArray() result (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY)</h3>
<p>
This code is casting the result of calling <code>toArray()</code> on a collection
to a type more specific than <code>Object[]</code>, as in:</p>
<pre>
String[] getAsArray(Collection&lt;String&gt; c) {
  return (String[]) c.toArray();
  }
</pre>
<p>This will usually fail by throwing a ClassCastException. The <code>toArray()</code>
of almost all collections return an <code>Object[]</code>. They can't really do anything else,
since the Collection object has no reference to the declared generic type of the collection.
<p>The correct way to do get an array of a specific type from a collection is to use
  <code>c.toArray(new String[]);</code>
  or <code>c.toArray(new String[c.size()]);</code> (the latter is slightly more efficient).
<p>There is one common/known exception exception to this. The <code>toArray()</code>
method of lists returned by <code>Arrays.asList(...)</code> will return a covariantly
typed array. For example, <code>Arrays.asArray(new String[] { "a" }).toArray()</code>
will return a <code>String []</code>. FindBugs attempts to detect and suppress
such cases, but may miss some.
