<h3>Dm: Can't use reflection to check for presence of annotation without runtime retention (DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION)</h3>
<p> Unless an annotation has itself been annotated with  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME), the annotation can't be observed using reflection
(e.g., by using the isAnnotationPresent method).
