<H2>Dm: Can't use reflection to check for presence of annotation with default retention (DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION)</H2>
<p> Unless an annotation has itself been annotated with a @Retention other than the default
of source-only retention, the annotation isn't retained in the classfile and can't be observed using reflection
	(e.g., by using the isAnnotationPresent method).
