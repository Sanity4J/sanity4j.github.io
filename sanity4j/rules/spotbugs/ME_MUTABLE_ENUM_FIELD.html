<h3>ME: Enum field is public and mutable (ME_MUTABLE_ENUM_FIELD)</h3>
<p>A mutable public field is defined inside a public enum, thus can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package.
  Though mutable enum fields may be used for lazy initialization, it's a bad practice to expose them to the outer world.
  Consider declaring this field final and/or package-private.</p>
