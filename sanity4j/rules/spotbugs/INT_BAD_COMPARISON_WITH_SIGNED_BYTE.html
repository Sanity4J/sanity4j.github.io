<h3>INT: Bad comparison of signed byte (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTE)</h3>
<p> Signed bytes can only have a value in the range -128 to 127. Comparing
a signed byte with a value outside that range is vacuous and likely to be incorrect.
To convert a signed byte <code>b</code> to an unsigned value in the range 0..255,
use <code>0xff &amp; b</code>
