<h3>UW: Unconditional wait (UW_UNCOND_WAIT)</h3>
<p> This method contains a call to <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code> which
  is not guarded by conditional control flow.&nbsp; The code should
    verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied
    before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored.
