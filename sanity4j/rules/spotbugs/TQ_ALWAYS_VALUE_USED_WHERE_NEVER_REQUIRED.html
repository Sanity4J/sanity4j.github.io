<h3>TQ: Value annotated as carrying a type qualifier used where a value that must not carry that qualifier is required (TQ_ALWAYS_VALUE_USED_WHERE_NEVER_REQUIRED)</h3>
<p>
A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is
consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value not
carry that annotation.
</p>
<p>
More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=ALWAYS
is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=NEVER.
</p>
<p>
For example, say that @NonNegative is a nickname for
the type qualifier annotation @Negative(when=When.NEVER).
The following code will generate this warning because
the return statement requires a @NonNegative value,
but receives one that is marked as @Negative.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public @NonNegative Integer example(@Negative Integer value) {
    return value;
}
</pre>
