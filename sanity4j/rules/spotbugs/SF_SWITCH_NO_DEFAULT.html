<h3>SF: Switch statement found where default case is missing (SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT)</h3>
<p> This method contains a switch statement where default case is missing.
  Usually you need to provide a default case.</p>
  <p>Because the analysis only looks at the generated bytecode, this warning can be incorrect triggered if
the default case is at the end of the switch statement and the switch statement doesn't contain break statements for other
cases.
