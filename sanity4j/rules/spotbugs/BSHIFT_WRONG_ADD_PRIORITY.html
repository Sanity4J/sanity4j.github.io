<h3>BSHIFT: Possible bad parsing of shift operation (BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITY)</h3>
<p>
The code performs an operation like (x &lt;&lt; 8 + y). Although this might be correct, probably it was meant 
to perform (x &lt;&lt; 8) + y, but shift operation has
a lower precedence, so it's actually parsed as x &lt;&lt; (8 + y).
