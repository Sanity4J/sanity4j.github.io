<h3>RV: Exception created and dropped rather than thrown (RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWN)</h3>
<p> This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it. For example,
something like </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
if (x &lt; 0)
  new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It was probably the intent of the programmer to throw the created exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
if (x &lt; 0)
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");
</pre>
</blockquote>
