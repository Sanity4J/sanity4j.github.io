<h3>SIC: Should be a static inner class (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)</h3>
<p> This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference
  to the object which created it.&nbsp; This reference makes the instances
  of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object
  alive longer than necessary.&nbsp; If possible, the class should be
   made static.
