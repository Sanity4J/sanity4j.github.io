<h3>MTIA: Class extends Struts Action class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELD)</h3>
<p>
This class extends from a Struts Action class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only
one instance of a struts Action class is created by the Struts framework, and used in a
multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider
only using method local variables. Only instance fields that are written outside of a monitor
are reported.
