<h3>SP: Method spins on field (SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD)</h3>
<p> This method spins in a loop which reads a field.&nbsp; The compiler
  may legally hoist the read out of the loop, turning the code into an
  infinite loop.&nbsp; The class should be changed so it uses proper
  synchronization (including wait and notify calls).</p>
