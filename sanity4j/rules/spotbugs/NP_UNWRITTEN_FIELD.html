<h3>NP: Read of unwritten field (NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD)</h3>
<p> The program is dereferencing a field that does not seem to ever have a non-null value written to it.
Unless the field is initialized via some mechanism not seen by the analysis,
dereferencing this value will generate a null pointer exception.
