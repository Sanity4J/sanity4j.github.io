<h3>Bx: Primitive value is boxed and then immediately unboxed (BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED)</h3>
<p>A primitive is boxed, and then immediately unboxed. This probably is due to a manual
    boxing in a place where an unboxed value is required, thus forcing the compiler
to immediately undo the work of the boxing.
