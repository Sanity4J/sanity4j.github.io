<h3>ESync: Empty synchronized block (ESync_EMPTY_SYNC)</h3>
<p> The code contains an empty synchronized block:</p>
<pre>
synchronized() {}
</pre>
<p>Empty synchronized blocks are far more subtle and hard to use correctly
than most people recognize, and empty synchronized blocks
are almost never a better solution
than less contrived solutions.
