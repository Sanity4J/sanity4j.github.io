<h3>DMI: Adding elements of an entry set may fail due to reuse of Entry objects (DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS)</h3>
<p> The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the
     underlying Map in which a single Entry object is reused and returned
     during the iteration.  As of Java 1.6, both IdentityHashMap
     and EnumMap did so. When iterating through such a Map,
     the Entry value is only valid until you advance to the next iteration.
     If, for example, you try to pass such an entrySet to an addAll method,
     things will go badly wrong.
