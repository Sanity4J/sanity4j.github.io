<h3>BSHIFT: Unsigned right shift cast to short/byte (ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT)</h3>
<p>
The code performs an unsigned right shift, whose result is then
cast to a short or byte, which discards the upper bits of the result.
Since the upper bits are discarded, there may be no difference between
a signed and unsigned right shift (depending upon the size of the shift).
