<h3>RV: Method checks to see if result of String.indexOf is positive (RV_CHECK_FOR_POSITIVE_INDEXOF)</h3>
<p> The method invokes String.indexOf and checks to see if the result is positive or non-positive.
   It is much more typical to check to see if the result is negative or non-negative. It is
   positive only if the substring checked for occurs at some place other than at the beginning of
   the String.</p>
