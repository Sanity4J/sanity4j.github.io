<h3>WMI: Inefficient use of keySet iterator instead of entrySet iterator (WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR)</h3>
<p> This method accesses the value of a Map entry, using a key that was retrieved from
a keySet iterator. It is more efficient to use an iterator on the entrySet of the map, to avoid the
Map.get(key) lookup.</p>
