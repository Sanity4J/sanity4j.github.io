<h3>Bx: Boxing a primitive to compare (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_COMPARE)</h3>
<p>A boxed primitive is created just to call compareTo method. It's more efficient to use static compare method 
  (for double and float since Java 1.4, for other primitive types since Java 1.7) which works on primitives directly.
