<h3>SA: Self assignment of local rather than assignment to field (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD)</h3>
<p> This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there
is a field with an identical name.
assignment appears to have been ; e.g.</p>
<pre>
  int foo;
  public void setFoo(int foo) {
    foo = foo;
  }
</pre>
<p>The assignment is useless. Did you mean to assign to the field instead?</p>
