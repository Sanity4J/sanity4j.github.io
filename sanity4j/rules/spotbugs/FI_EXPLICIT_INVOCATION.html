<h3>FI: Explicit invocation of finalizer (FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION)</h3>
<p> This method contains an explicit invocation of the <code>finalize()</code>
  method on an object.&nbsp; Because finalizer methods are supposed to be
  executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea.</p>
<p>If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the
finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads.
Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize
on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread.</p>
