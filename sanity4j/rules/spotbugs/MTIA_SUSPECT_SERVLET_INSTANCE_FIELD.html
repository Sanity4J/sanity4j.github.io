<h3>MTIA: Class extends Servlet class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD)</h3>
<p>
This class extends from a Servlet class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only
one instance of a Servlet class is created by the J2EE framework, and used in a
multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider
only using method local variables.
