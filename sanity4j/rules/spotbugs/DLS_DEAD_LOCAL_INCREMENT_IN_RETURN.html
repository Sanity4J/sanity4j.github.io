<h3>DLS: Useless increment in return statement (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURN)</h3>
<p>This statement has a return such as <code>return x++;</code>.
A postfix increment/decrement does not impact the value of the expression,
so this increment/decrement has no effect.
Please verify that this statement does the right thing.
