<h3>NP: Synchronize and null check on the same field. (NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD)</h3>
<p>Since the field is synchronized on, it seems not likely to be null.
If it is null and then synchronized on a NullPointerException will be
thrown and the check would be pointless. Better to synchronize on
another field.</p>
