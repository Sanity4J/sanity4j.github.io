<h3>NP: Possible null pointer dereference due to return value of called method (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE)</h3>
<p> The return value from a method is dereferenced without a null check,
and the return value of that method is one that should generally be checked
for null.  This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed.
