<h3>MS: Field is a mutable collection (MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION)</h3>
<p>A mutable collection instance is assigned to a final static field, 
   thus can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package.
   Consider wrapping this field into Collections.unmodifiableSet/List/Map/etc.
   to avoid this vulnerability.</p>
