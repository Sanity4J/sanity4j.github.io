<h3>UG: Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method (UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET)</h3>
<p> This class contains similarly-named get and set
  methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not.&nbsp;
  This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get
  method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object.&nbsp;
  The get method should be made synchronized.</p>
