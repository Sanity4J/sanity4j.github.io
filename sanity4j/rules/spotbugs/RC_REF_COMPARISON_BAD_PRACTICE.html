<h3>RC: Suspicious reference comparison to constant (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE)</h3>
<p> This method compares a reference value to a constant using the == or != operator,
where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally
with the equals() method.
It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since
they are different objects.
Examples of classes which should generally
not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.</p>
