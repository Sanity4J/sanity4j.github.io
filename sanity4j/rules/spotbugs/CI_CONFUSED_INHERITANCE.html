<h3>CI: Class is final but declares protected field (CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE)</h3>
<p>
This class is declared to be final, but declares fields to be protected. Since the class
is final, it can not be derived from, and the use of protected is confusing. The access
modifier for the field should be changed to private or public to represent the true
use for the field.
