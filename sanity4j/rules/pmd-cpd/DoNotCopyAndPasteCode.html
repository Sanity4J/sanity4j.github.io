<p>
	Don't copy &amp; paste large chunks of code. The severity of this rule is based on the size of the duplication.
</p>
<p>
	Having lots of duplicated code leads to duplicated bugs and higher maintenance costs. 
	Where possible, refactor the code by either moving it into a parameterized method if it 
	is internal to a class, or moving it to a common utility class if it can be used by many classes.
