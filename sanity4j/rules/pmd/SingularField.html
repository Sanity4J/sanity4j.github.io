<p>Fields whose scopes are limited to just single methods do not rely on the containing object to provide them to other methods. They may be better implemented as local variables within those methods.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/design/SingularFieldRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.design.SingularFieldRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
public class Foo {
    private int x;  // no reason to exist at the Foo instance level
    public void foo(int y) {
     x = y + 5;
     return x;
    }
}
</pre></div>
