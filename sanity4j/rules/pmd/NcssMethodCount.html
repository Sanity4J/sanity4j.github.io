This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines
of code for a given method. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm,
lines of code that are split are counted as one.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class Foo extends Bar {
 public int methd() {
     super.methd();





 //this method only has 1 NCSS lines
      return 1;
 }
}

   
            </pre></div>
  
        

        
        
            
                <p>This rule has the following properties:</p>
