<h2><a name="AvoidCatchingThrowable"></a>AvoidCatchingThrowable</h2>

<p>Catching Throwable errors is not recommended since its scope is very broad. It includes runtime issues such as OutOfMemoryError that should be exposed and managed separately.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/strictexception/AvoidCatchingThrowableRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.strictexception.AvoidCatchingThrowableRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
	
public void bar() {
	try {
     // do something
    } catch (Throwable th) {  // should not catch Throwable
		th.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
	
</pre></div>
