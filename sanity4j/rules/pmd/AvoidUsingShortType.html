<H2>AvoidUsingShortType</H2>
Java uses the 'short' type to reduce memory usage, not to optimize calculation. In fact, the jvm does not have any
            arithmetic capabilities for the short type: the jvm must convert the short into an int, do the proper caculation
            and convert the int back to a short. So, the use of the 'short' type may have a greater impact than memory usage.
