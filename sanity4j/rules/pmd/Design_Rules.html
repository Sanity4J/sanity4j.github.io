                                <li> UseSingleton: 
    	
If you have a class that has nothing but static methods, consider making it a Singleton.
Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may
well include non-static methods.  Also, if you want this class to be a Singleton,
remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
		
    </li>
                            
                                <li> SimplifyBooleanReturns: 
Avoid unnecessary if..then..else statements when returning a boolean.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> SimplifyBooleanExpressions: 
Avoid unnecessary comparisons in boolean expressions - this complicates simple code.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> SwitchStmtsShouldHaveDefault: 
Switch statements should have a default label.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidDeeplyNestedIfStmts: 
Deeply nested if..then statements are hard to read.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidReassigningParameters: 
Reassigning values to parameters is a questionable practice.  Use a temporary local variable instead.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> SwitchDensity: 
 A high ratio of statements to labels in a switch statement implies that the switch
 statement is doing too much work.  Consider moving the statements into new
 methods, or creating subclasses based on the switch variable.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> ConstructorCallsOverridableMethod: 
Calling overridable methods during construction poses a risk of invoking methods on an
incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to discern.
It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to
replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call
super().  If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method,
the subclass may be completely uninstantiable.   Note that this includes method calls
throughout the control flow graph - i.e., if a constructor Foo() calls a private method
bar() that calls a public method buz(), this denotes a problem.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AccessorClassGeneration: 
Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor.
A factory method, or non-privitization of the constructor can eliminate this situation.
The generated class file is actually an interface.  It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package
scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter.  This turns a private constructor effectively into
one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> FinalFieldCouldBeStatic: 
If a final field is assigned to a compile-time constant, it could be
made static, thus saving overhead in each object at runtime.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> CloseResource: 
Ensure that resources (like Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects) are always closed after use.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> NonStaticInitializer: 
A nonstatic initializer block will be called any time a constructor
is invoked (just prior to invoking the constructor).  While this
is a valid language construct, it is rarely used and is confusing.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> DefaultLabelNotLastInSwitchStmt: 
By convention, the default label should be the last label in a switch statement.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> NonCaseLabelInSwitchStatement: 
A non-case label (e.g. a named break/continue label) was present in a switch statement.
This legal, but confusing. It is easy to mix up the case labels and the non-case labels.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> OptimizableToArrayCall: 
A call to Collection.toArray can use the Collection's size vs an empty Array of the desired type.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> BadComparison: 
Avoid equality comparisons with Double.NaN - these are likely to be logic errors.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> EqualsNull: 
Inexperienced programmers sometimes confuse comparison concepts
and use equals() to compare to null.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> ConfusingTernary: 
In an "if" expression with an "else" clause, avoid negation in
the test.  For example, rephrase:
if (x != y) diff(); else same();
as:
if (x == y) same(); else diff();
Most "if (x != y)" cases without an "else" are often return
cases, so consistent use of this rule makes the code easier
to read.  Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such
as "does the error case go first?" or "does the common case
go first?".
        </li>
                            
                                <li> InstantiationToGetClass: 
Avoid instantiating an object just to call getClass() on it; use the .class public member instead.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> IdempotentOperations: 
Avoid idempotent operations - they are have no effect.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale: 
Be sure to specify a Locale when creating a new instance of SimpleDateFormat.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> ImmutableField: 
Identifies private fields whose values never change once they are initialized either in the declaration of the field or by
a constructor.  This aids in converting existing classes to immutable classes.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UseLocaleWithCaseConversions: 
When doing a String.toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() call, use a Locale.  This avoids
problems with certain locales, i.e. Turkish.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidProtectedFieldInFinalClass: 
Do not use protected fields in final classes since they cannot be subclassed.
Clarify your intent by using private or package access modifiers instead.
         </li>
                            
                                <li> AssignmentToNonFinalStatic: 
Identifies a possible unsafe usage of a static field.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass: 
A class that has private constructors and does not have any static methods or fields cannot be used.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidSynchronizedAtMethodLevel: 
  Method level synchronization can backfire when new code is added to the method.  Block-level
  synchronization helps to ensure that only the code that needs synchronization gets it.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> MissingBreakInSwitch: 
A switch statement without an enclosed break statement may be a bug.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UseNotifyAllInsteadOfNotify: 
Thread.notify() awakens a thread monitoring the object. If more than one thread is monitoring, then only
one is chosen.  The thread chosen is arbitrary; thus it's usually safer to call notifyAll() instead.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidInstanceofChecksInCatchClause: 
Each caught exception type should be handled in its own catch clause.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod: 
The abstract class does not contain any abstract methods. An abstract class suggests
an incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing the
abstract methods. If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiated
direcly) a protected constructor can be provided prevent direct instantiation.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> SimplifyConditional: 
No need to check for null before an instanceof; the instanceof keyword returns false when given a null argument.
          </li>
                            
                                <li> CompareObjectsWithEquals: 
 Use equals() to compare object references; avoid comparing them with ==.
  </li>
                            
                                <li> PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons: 
 Position literals first in String comparisons - that way if the String is null you won't get a NullPointerException, it'll just return false.
  </li>
                            
                                <li> UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn: 
Avoid unnecessarily creating local variables
      </li>
                            
                                <li> NonThreadSafeSingleton: 
Non-thread safe singletons can result in bad state changes. Eliminate
static singletons if possible by instantiating the object directly. Static
singletons are usually not needed as only a single instance exists anyway.
Other possible fixes are to synchronize the entire method or to use an
initialize-on-demand holder class (do not use the double-check idiom).

        </li>
                            
                                <li> UncommentedEmptyMethod: 
Uncommented Empty Method finds instances where a method does not contain
statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty methods
it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional
empty methods.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UncommentedEmptyConstructor: 
Uncommented Empty Constructor finds instances where a constructor does not
contain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty
constructors it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented)
and unintentional empty constructors.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidConstantsInterface: 
     An interface should be used only to model a behaviour of a
    class: using an interface as a container of constants is a poor usage pattern.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter: 
SimpleDateFormat is not synchronized. Sun recomends separate format instances
for each thread. If multiple threads must access a static formatter, the
formatter must be synchronized either on method or block level.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> PreserveStackTrace: 
Throwing a new exception from a catch block without passing the original exception into the
new Exception will cause the true stack trace to be lost, and can make it difficult to
debug effectively.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UseCollectionIsEmpty: 
The isEmpty() method on java.util.Collection is provided to see if a collection has any elements.
Comparing the value of size() to 0 merely duplicates existing behavior.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal: 
A class with only private constructors should be final, unless the private
constructor is called by a inner class.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> EmptyMethodInAbstractClassShouldBeAbstract: 
An empty method in an abstract class should be abstract instead, as developer may rely on this empty implementation
rather than code the appropriate one.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> SingularField: 
      		
This field is used in only one method and the first usage is assigning a value
to the field. This probably means that the field can be changed to a local variable.
			
      </li>
                            
                                <li> ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull: 
            
            For any method that returns an array, it's a better behavior to return an empty array rather than a null reference.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod: 
            
			If the abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be just a data container that is not to be instantiated. In this case, it's probably
			better to use a private or a protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement: 
            
				Swith are designed complex branches, and allow branches to share treatement. Using a switch for only 2
				branches is ill advised, as switches are not as easy to understand as if. In this case, it's most likely
				is a good idea to use a if statement instead, at least to increase code readability.
