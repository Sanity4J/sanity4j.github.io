<H2>TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement</H2>
Swith are designed complex branches, and allow branches to share treatement. Using a switch for only 2
				branches is ill advised, as switches are not as easy to understand as if. In this case, it's most likely
				is a good idea to use a if statement instead, at least to increase code readability.
