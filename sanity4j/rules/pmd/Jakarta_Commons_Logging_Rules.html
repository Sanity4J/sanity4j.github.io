                                <li> UseCorrectExceptionLogging: 
To make sure the full stacktrace is printed out, use the logging statement with 2 arguments: a String and a Throwable.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> ProperLogger: 
A logger should normally be defined private static final and have the correct class.
Private final Log log; is also allowed for rare cases where loggers need to be passed
around, with the restriction that the logger needs to be passed into the constructor.
