                                <li> AvoidCatchingThrowable: 
This is dangerous because it casts too wide a net; it can catch things like OutOfMemoryError.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> SignatureDeclareThrowsException: 
It is unclear which exceptions that can be thrown from the methods.
It might be difficult to document and understand the vague interfaces.
Use either a class derived from RuntimeException or a checked exception.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> ExceptionAsFlowControl: 
          Using Exceptions as flow control leads to GOTOish code and obscures true exceptions when debugging.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidCatchingNPE: 
      Code should never throw NPE under normal circumstances.  A catch block may hide the original error, causing other more subtle errors in its wake.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidThrowingRawExceptionTypes: 
Avoid throwing certain exception types. Rather than throw a raw RuntimeException, Throwable,
Exception, or Error, use a subclassed exception or error instead.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidThrowingNullPointerException: 
Avoid throwing a NullPointerException - it's confusing because most people will assume that the
virtual machine threw it. Consider using an IllegalArgumentException instead; this will be
clearly seen as a programmer-initiated exception.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidRethrowingException: 
     Catch blocks that merely rethrow a caught exception only add to code size and runtime complexity.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> DoNotExtendJavaLangError: 
      [
        Errors are system exceptions. Do not extend them.
      
    </li>
                            
                                <li> DoNotThrowExceptionInFinally: 
			[
			      Throwing exception in a finally block is confusing. It may mask exception or a defect of the code,
			      it also render code cleanup uninstable.
			Note: This is a PMD implementation of the Lint4j rule "A throw in a finally block"
