<p>The dataflow analysis tracks local definitions, undefinitions and references to variables on different paths on the data flow. From those informations there can be found various problems.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  
<li>UR - Anomaly: There is a reference to a variable that was not defined before. This is a bug and leads to an error.</li>
  
<li>DU - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is undefined. These anomalies may appear in normal source text.</li>
  
<li>DD - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is redefined. This is ominous but don&#x2019;t have to be a bug.</li>
</ol>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/controversial/DataflowAnomalyAnalysisRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.controversial.DataflowAnomalyAnalysisRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>

public void foo() {
  int buz = 5;
  buz = 6; // redefinition of buz -&gt; dd-anomaly
  foo(buz);
  buz = 2;
} // buz is undefined when leaving scope -&gt; du-anomaly
