		<p>Since: PMD 3.9</p>
		<p>The dataflow analysis tracks local definitions, undefinitions and references to variables on different paths on the data flow.
From those informations there can be found various problems.

1. UR - Anomaly: There is a reference to a variable that was not defined before. This is a bug and leads to an error.
2. DU - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is undefined. These anomalies may appear in normal source text.
3. DD - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is redefined. This is ominous but don't have to be a bug.
          </p>
		
		
		    
		    
    		    
    		    
    		    

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:
    		    <a href="../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/dfa/DaaRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.dfa.DaaRule</a>
    		    </p>
		    
	    
	    
        
        
        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class Foo {
    public void foo() {
	 int buz = 5;
	 buz = 6; // redefinition of buz -&gt; dd-anomaly
	 foo(buz);
	 buz = 2;
    } // buz is undefined when leaving scope -&gt; du-anomaly
}

          
            </pre></div>
  
        

        
        
            
                <p>This rule has the following properties:</p>
                <table class="bodyTable"><th>Name</th><th>Default value</th><th>Description</th>
                
                
                    <tr class="b">
                    <td>maxviolations</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                    <td>The maximum number of violations per class.</td>
                    </tr>
                
                    <tr class="a">
                    <td>maxpaths</td>
                    <td>1000</td>
                    <td>The maximum number of checked paths per method. A lower value will increase the performance of the rule but may decrease the number of found anomalies.</td>
                    </tr>
                
                </table>
