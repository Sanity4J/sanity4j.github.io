                                <li> LocalVariableCouldBeFinal: 
A local variable assigned only once can be declared final.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> MethodArgumentCouldBeFinal: 
A method argument that is never assigned can be declared final.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidInstantiatingObjectsInLoops: 
Detects when a new object is created inside a loop
    </li>
                            
                                <li> UseArrayListInsteadOfVector: 
ArrayList is a much better Collection implementation than Vector.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> SimplifyStartsWith: 
Since it passes in a literal of length 1, this call to String.startsWith can be rewritten using String.charAt(0) to save some time.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UseStringBufferForStringAppends: 
Finds usages of += for appending strings.
           </li>
                            
                                <li> UseArraysAsList: 
   The class java.util.Arrays has a "asList" method that
   should be use when you want to create a new List from
   an array of objects. It is faster than executing a loop to
   cpy all the elements of the array one by one
     </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidArrayLoops: 
    Instead of copying data between two arrays, use
    System.arraycopy method
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UnnecessaryWrapperObjectCreation: 
Parsing method should be called directy instead.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AddEmptyString: 
Finds empty string literals which are being added. This is an inefficient way 
to convert any type to a String.
        </li>
