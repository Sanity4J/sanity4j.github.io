                                <li> NoLongScripts:  Scripts should be part of Tag Libraries, rather than part of JSP pages.
			</li>
                            
                                <li> NoScriptlets:  Scriptlets should be factored into Tag Libraries or JSP declarations,
			rather than being part of JSP pages. </li>
                            
                                <li> NoInlineStyleInformation:  Style information should be put in CSS files, not in JSPs.
			Therefore, don't use &lt;B&gt; or &lt;FONT&gt; tags, or attributes like "align='center'".  </li>
                            
                                <li> NoClassAttribute: Do not use an attribute called 'class'. Use "styleclass" for CSS styles.
			</li>
                            
                                <li> NoJspForward: Do not do a forward from within a JSP file.
			</li>
                            
                                <li> IframeMissingSrcAttribute: 
		  IFrames which are missing a src element can cause security information popups 
		  in IE if you are accessing the page through SSL. See http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q261188
			</li>
                            
                                <li> NoHtmlComments: 
		  In a production system, HTML comments increase the payload between the application 
		  server to the client, and serve little other purpose. Consider switching to 
		  JSP comments.
			</li>
                            
                                <li> DuplicateJspImports: Avoid duplicate import statements inside JSP's.  </li>
                            
                                <li> JspEncoding: 
            
A missing 'meta' tag or page directive will trigger this rule, as well as a non-UTF-8 charset.
            
        </li>
