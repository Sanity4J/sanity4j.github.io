<H2>NullAssignment</H2>
Assigning a "null" to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually
 bad form.  Some times, the assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn't
 completely understand what is going on in the code.  NOTE: This sort of assignment
 may in rare cases be useful to encourage garbage collection.  If that's what you're using
 it for, by all means, disregard this rule :-)

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                
 
 public class Foo {
   public void bar() {
     Object x = null; // This is OK.
     x = new Object();
     // Big, complex piece of code here.
     x = null; // This is BAD.
     // Big, complex piece of code here.
   }
 }

 
      
            </pre></div>
