<h2><a name="NullAssignment"></a>NullAssignment</h2>

<p>Assigning a &#x201c;null&#x201d; to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually bad form. Sometimes, this type of assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn&#x2019;t completely understand what is going on in the code.</p>
<p>NOTE: This sort of assignment may used in some cases to dereference objects and encourage garbage collection.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/controversial/NullAssignmentRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.controversial.NullAssignmentRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
 
public void bar() {
  Object x = null; // this is OK
  x = new Object();
     // big, complex piece of code here
  x = null; // this is not required
     // big, complex piece of code here
}

 
</pre></div>
