                                <li> BeanMembersShouldSerialize: 
If a class is a bean, or is referenced by a bean directly or indirectly
it needs to be serializable. Member variables need to be marked as transient,
static, or have accessor methods in the class. Marking variables
as transient is the safest and easiest modification. Accessor methods should
follow the Java naming conventions, i.e.if you have a variable foo, you should
provide getFoo and setFoo methods.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> MissingSerialVersionUID: 
Classes that are serializable should provide a serialVersionUID field.
      </li>
