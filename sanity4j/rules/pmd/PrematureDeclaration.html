<h2><a name="PrematureDeclaration"></a>PrematureDeclaration</h2>

<p>Checks for variables that are defined before they might be used. A reference is deemed to be premature if it is created right before a block of code that doesn&#x2019;t use it that also has the ability to return or throw an exception.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/optimizations/PrematureDeclarationRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.optimizations.PrematureDeclarationRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
              
public int getLength(String[] strings) {
  
  int length = 0;	// declared prematurely

  if (strings == null || strings.length == 0) return 0;
  
  for (String str : strings) {
    length += str.length();
    }

  return length;
}
