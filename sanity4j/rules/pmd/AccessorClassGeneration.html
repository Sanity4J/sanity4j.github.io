<h2><a name="AccessorClassGeneration"></a>AccessorClassGeneration</h2>

<p>Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor&#x2019;s class often causes the generation of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privatization of the constructor can eliminate this situation. The generated class file is actually an interface. It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter. This turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/design/AccessorClassGenerationRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.design.AccessorClassGenerationRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
  
public class Outer {
 void method(){
  Inner ic = new Inner();//Causes generation of accessor class
 }
 public class Inner {
  private Inner(){}
 }
}
  
</pre></div>
