<H2>AccessorClassGeneration</H2>
Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor.
A factory method, or non-privitization of the constructor can eliminate this situation.
The generated class file is actually an interface.  It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package
scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter.  This turns a private constructor effectively into
one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.

    <div class="source"><pre>
                
  
public class Outer {
 void method(){
  Inner ic = new Inner();//Causes generation of accessor class
 }
 public class Inner {
  private Inner(){}
 }
}
  
      
            </pre></div>
