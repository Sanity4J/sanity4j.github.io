                                <li> MethodReturnsInternalArray: 
Exposing internal arrays directly allows the user to modify some code that could be critical.
It is safer to return a copy of the array.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> ArrayIsStoredDirectly: 
Constructors and methods receiving arrays should clone objects and store the copy.
This prevents that future changes from the user affect the internal functionality.
