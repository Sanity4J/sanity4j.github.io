Failing to pre-size a StringBuffer properly could cause it to re-size many times
during runtime. This rule checks the characters that are actually passed into
StringBuffer.append(), but represents a best guess "worst case" scenario. An
empty StringBuffer constructor initializes the object to 16 characters. This default
is assumed if the length of the constructor can not be determined.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        StringBuffer bad = new StringBuffer();
        bad.append("This is a long string, will exceed the default 16 characters");//bad
        StringBuffer good = new StringBuffer(41);
        good.append("This is a long string, which is pre-sized");//good
    }
}

    
            </pre></div>
