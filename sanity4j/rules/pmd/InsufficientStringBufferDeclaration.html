<h2><a name="InsufficientStringBufferDeclaration"></a>InsufficientStringBufferDeclaration</h2>

<p>Failing to pre-size a StringBuffer or StringBuilder properly could cause it to re-size many times during runtime. This rule attempts to determine the total number the characters that are actually passed into StringBuffer.append(), but represents a best guess &#x201c;worst case&#x201d; scenario. An empty StringBuffer/StringBuilder constructor initializes the object to 16 characters. This default is assumed if the length of the constructor can not be determined.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/strings/InsufficientStringBufferDeclarationRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.strings.InsufficientStringBufferDeclarationRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>

StringBuffer bad = new StringBuffer();
bad.append(&quot;This is a long string that will exceed the default 16 characters&quot;);
        
StringBuffer good = new StringBuffer(41);
good.append(&quot;This is a long string, which is pre-sized&quot;);

</pre></div>
