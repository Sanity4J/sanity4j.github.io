<h2><a name="TooManyFields"></a>TooManyFields</h2>

<p>Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer fields, possibly through grouping related fields in new objects. For example, a class with individual city/state/zip fields could park them within a single Address field.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/codesize/TooManyFieldsRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.codesize.TooManyFieldsRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
   
public class Person {	// too many separate fields
   int birthYear;
   int birthMonth;
   int birthDate;
   float height;
   float weight;
}

public class Person {	// this is more manageable
   Date birthDate;
   BodyMeasurements measurements;
}
