Classes that have too many fields could be redesigned to have fewer fields, possibly
 through some nested object grouping of some of the information.  For example, a class with
 city/state/zip fields could instead have one Address field.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:
    		    <a href="../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/rules/design/TooManyFields.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.TooManyFields</a>
    		    </p>
		    
	    
	    
        
        
        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                
   
public class Person {
   String one;
   int two;
   int three;
   [... many more public fields ...]
}
   
      
            </pre></div>
  
        

        
        
            
                <p>This rule has the following properties:</p>
                <table class="bodyTable"><th>Name</th><th>Default value</th><th>Description</th>
                
                
                    <tr class="a">
                    <td>maxfields</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>The field count reporting threshold </td>
                    </tr>
                
                </table>
