<p>When you write a public method, you should be thinking in terms of an API. If your method is public, it means other class will use it, therefore, you want (or need) to offer a comprehensive and evolutive API. If you pass a lot of information as a simple series of Strings, you may think of using an Object to represent all those information. You&#x2019;ll get a simpler API (such as doWork(Workload workload), rather than a tedious series of Strings) and more importantly, if you need at some point to pass extra data, you&#x2019;ll be able to do so by simply modifying or extending Workload without any modification to your API.</p>

public class MyClass {
  public void connect(String username,
    String pssd,
    String databaseName,
    String databaseAdress)
    // Instead of those parameters object
    // would ensure a cleaner API and permit
    // to add extra data transparently (no code change):
    // void connect(UserData data);
    {
