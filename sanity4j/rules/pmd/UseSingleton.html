If you have a class that has nothing but static methods, consider making it a Singleton.
Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may
well include non-static methods.  Also, if you want this class to be a Singleton,
remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class MaybeASingleton {
 public static void foo() {}
 public static void bar() {}
}
