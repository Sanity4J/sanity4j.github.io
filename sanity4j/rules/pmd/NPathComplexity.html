The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
   A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce complexity.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

    		    </p>
		    
	    
	    
        
        
        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                
 
 public class Foo {
  void bar() {
   // lots of complicated code
  }
 }
