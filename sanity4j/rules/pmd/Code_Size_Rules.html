                                <li> NPathComplexity: 
   The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
   A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce complexity.
   </li>
                            
                                <li> ExcessiveMethodLength: 
Violations of this rule usually indicate that the method is doing
too much.  Try to reduce the method size by creating helper methods and removing any copy/pasted code.
   </li>
                            
                                <li> ExcessiveParameterList: 
Long parameter lists can indicate that a new object should be created to
 wrap the numerous parameters.  Basically, try to group the parameters together.
   </li>
                            
                                <li> ExcessiveClassLength: 
Long Class files are indications that the class may be trying to
do too much.  Try to break it down, and reduce the size to something
manageable.
   </li>
                            
                                <li> CyclomaticComplexity: 
   		
Complexity is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the
method entry.  The decision points are 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels'.  Generally,
1-4 is low complexity, 5-7 indicates moderate complexity, 8-10 is high complexity,
 and 11+ is very high complexity.
		
   </li>
                            
                                <li> ExcessivePublicCount: 
A large number of public methods and attributes declared in a class can indicate the
 class may need to be broken up as increased effort will be required to thoroughly test it.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> TooManyFields: 
Classes that have too many fields could be redesigned to have fewer fields, possibly
 through some nested object grouping of some of the information.  For example, a class with
 city/state/zip fields could instead have one Address field.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> NcssMethodCount: 
This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines
of code for a given method. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm,
lines of code that are split are counted as one.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> NcssTypeCount: 
This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines
of code for a given type. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm,
lines of code that are split are counted as one.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> NcssConstructorCount: 
This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines
of code for a given constructor. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm,
lines of code that are split are counted as one.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> TooManyMethods: 
            
A class with too many methods is probably a good suspect for refactoring, in order to reduce its complexity and find a way to
have more fine grained objects.
            
        </li>
