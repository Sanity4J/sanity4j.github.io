                                <li> LooseCoupling: 
Avoid using implementation types (i.e., HashSet); use the interface (i.e, Set) instead
      </li>
                            
                                <li> CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable: 
The method clone() should only be implemented if the class implements the 
Cloneable interface with the exception of a final method that only throws 
CloneNotSupportedException. This version uses PMD's type resolution facilities, 
and can detect if the class implements or extends a Cloneable class
        </li>
                            
                                <li> UnusedImports: 
    Avoid unused import statements. This rule will find unused on demand imports, i.e. import com.foo.*.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> SignatureDeclareThrowsException: 
It is unclear which exceptions that can be thrown from the methods.
It might be difficult to document and understand the vague interfaces.
Use either a class derived from RuntimeException or a checked exception.

Junit classes are excluded.
