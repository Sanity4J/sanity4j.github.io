                                <li> UnnecessaryConstructor: 
This rule detects when a constructor is not necessary; i.e., when there's only one constructor,
it's public, has an empty body, and takes no arguments.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> NullAssignment: 
 Assigning a "null" to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually
 bad form.  Some times, the assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn't
 completely understand what is going on in the code.  NOTE: This sort of assignment
 may in rare cases be useful to encourage garbage collection.  If that's what you're using
 it for, by all means, disregard this rule :-)
      </li>
                            
                                <li> OnlyOneReturn: 
A method should have only one exit point, and that should be the last statement in the method.
     </li>
                            
                                <li> UnusedModifier: 
 Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and
 methods are public abstract.
 Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public
 and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static).
 For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context
 are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.
     </li>
                            
                                <li> AssignmentInOperand: 
Avoid assignments in operands; this can make code more complicated and harder to read.
  </li>
                            
                                <li> AtLeastOneConstructor: 
Each class should declare at least one constructor.
  </li>
                            
                                <li> DontImportSun: 
Avoid importing anything from the 'sun.*' packages.  These packages are not portable and are likely to change.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> SuspiciousOctalEscape: 
A suspicious octal escape sequence was found inside a String literal.
The Java language specification (section 3.10.6) says an octal
escape sequence inside a literal String shall consist of a backslash
followed by:

   OctalDigit | OctalDigit OctalDigit | ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit

Any octal escape sequence followed by non-octal digits can be confusing,
e.g. "\038" is interpreted as the octal escape sequence "\03" followed by
the literal character "8".
      </li>
                            
                                <li> CallSuperInConstructor: 
It is a good practice to call super() in a constructor. If super() is not called but
 another constructor (such as an overloaded constructor) is called, this rule will not report it.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> UnnecessaryParentheses: 
Sometimes expressions are wrapped in unnecessary parentheses,
making them look like a function call.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> DefaultPackage: 
Use explicit scoping instead of the default package private level.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> BooleanInversion: 
Use bitwise inversion to invert boolean values - it's the fastest way to do this.
See http://www.javaspecialists.co.za/archive/newsletter.do?issue=042&amp;locale=en_US for specific details
      </li>
                            
                                <li> DataflowAnomalyAnalysis: The dataflow analysis tracks local definitions, undefinitions and references to variables on different paths on the data flow.
From those informations there can be found various problems.

1. UR - Anomaly: There is a reference to a variable that was not defined before. This is a bug and leads to an error.
2. DU - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is undefined. These anomalies may appear in normal source text.
3. DD - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is redefined. This is ominous but don't have to be a bug.
          </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidFinalLocalVariable: 
Avoid using final local variables, turn them into fields.
         </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidUsingShortType: 
            
            Java uses the 'short' type to reduce memory usage, not to optimize calculation. In fact, the jvm does not have any
            arithmetic capabilities for the short type: the jvm must convert the short into an int, do the proper caculation
            and convert the int back to a short. So, the use of the 'short' type may have a greater impact than memory usage.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidUsingVolatile: 
            
Use of the keyword 'volatile' is general used to fine tune a Java application, and therefore, requires
a good expertise of the Java Memory Model. Moreover, its range of action is somewhat misknown. Therefore,
the volatile keyword should not be used for maintenance purpose and portability.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidUsingNativeCode: 
            
                As JVM and Java language offer already many help in creating application, it should be
                very rare to have to rely on non-java code. Even though, it is rare to actually have to
                use Java Native Interface (JNI). As the use of JNI make application less portable, and
                harder to maintain, it is not recommended.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidAccessibilityAlteration: 
            
            Methods such as getDeclaredConstructors(), getDeclaredConstructor(Class[]) and setAccessible(),
            as the interface PrivilegedAction, allow to alter, at runtime, the visilibilty of variable, classes, or
            methods, even if they are private. Obviously, no one should do so, as such behavior is against everything
            encapsulation principal stands for.
            
        </li>
                            
                                <li> DoNotCallGarbageCollectionExplicitly: 
	        
		        Calls to System.gc(), Runtime.getRuntime().gc(), and System.runFinalization() are not advised. Code should have the
		        same behavior whether the garbage collection is disabled using the option -Xdisableexplicitgc or not.
		        Moreover, "modern" jvms do a very good job handling garbage collections. If memory usage issues unrelated to memory
			leaks develop within an application, it should be dealt with JVM options rather than within the code itself.
