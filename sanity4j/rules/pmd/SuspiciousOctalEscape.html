<h2><a name="SuspiciousOctalEscape"></a>SuspiciousOctalEscape</h2>

<p>A suspicious octal escape sequence was found inside a String literal. The Java language specification (section 3.10.6) says an octal escape sequence inside a literal String shall consist of a backslash followed by:</p>
<p>OctalDigit | OctalDigit OctalDigit | ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit</p>
<p>Any octal escape sequence followed by non-octal digits can be confusing, e.g. &#x201c;\038&#x201d; is interpreted as the octal escape sequence &#x201c;\03&#x201d; followed by the literal character &#x201c;8&#x201d;.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/controversial/SuspiciousOctalEscapeRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.controversial.SuspiciousOctalEscapeRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>

public void foo() {
  // interpreted as octal 12, followed by character '8'
  System.out.println(&quot;suspicious: \128&quot;);
}

</pre></div>
