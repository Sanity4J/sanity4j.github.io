<H2>SuspiciousOctalEscape</H2>
A suspicious octal escape sequence was found inside a String literal.
The Java language specification (section 3.10.6) says an octal
escape sequence inside a literal String shall consist of a backslash
followed by:

   OctalDigit | OctalDigit OctalDigit | ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit

Any octal escape sequence followed by non-octal digits can be confusing,
e.g. "\038" is interpreted as the octal escape sequence "\03" followed by
the literal character "8".

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:

        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

public class Foo {
 public void foo() {
  // interpreted as octal 12, followed by character '8'
  System.out.println("suspicious: \128");
 }
}

      
            </pre></div>
