<p>For classes that only have static methods, consider making them utility classes. Note that this doesn&#x2019;t apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may well include non-static methods. Also, if you want this class to be a utility class, remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation. (Note, that this use was known before PMD 5.1.0 as UseSingleton).</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/design/UseUtilityClassRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.design.UseUtilityClassRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>

public class MaybeAUtility {
  public static void foo() {}
  public static void bar() {}
}
