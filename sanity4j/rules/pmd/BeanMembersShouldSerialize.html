If a class is a bean, or is referenced by a bean directly or indirectly
it needs to be serializable. Member variables need to be marked as transient,
static, or have accessor methods in the class. Marking variables
as transient is the safest and easiest modification. Accessor methods should
follow the Java naming conventions, i.e.if you have a variable foo, you should
provide getFoo and setFoo methods.

    		    <p>This rule is defined by the following Java class:
    		    <a href="../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/rules/BeanMembersShouldSerializeRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.BeanMembersShouldSerializeRule</a>
    		    </p>
		    
	    
	    
        
        
        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                

  private transient int someFoo;//good, it's transient
  private static int otherFoo;// also OK
  private int moreFoo;// OK, has proper accessors, see below
  private int badFoo;//bad, should be marked transient


  private void setMoreFoo(int moreFoo){
        this.moreFoo = moreFoo;
  }

  private int getMoreFoo(){
        return this.moreFoo;
  }


    
            </pre></div>
  
        

        
        
            
                <p>This rule has the following properties:</p>
                <table class="bodyTable"><th>Name</th><th>Default value</th><th>Description</th>
                
                
                    <tr class="a">
                    <td>prefix</td>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>A variable prefix to skip, i.e., m_</td>
                    </tr>
                
                </table>
