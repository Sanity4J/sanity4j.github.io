                                <li> ShortVariable: 
Detects when a field, local, or parameter has a very short name.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> LongVariable: 
Detects when a field, formal or local variable is declared with a long name.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> ShortMethodName: 
Detects when very short method names are used.
     </li>
                            
                                <li> VariableNamingConventions: 
A variable naming conventions rule - customize this to your liking.  Currently, it
 checks for final variables that should be fully capitalized and non-final variables
 that should not include underscores.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> MethodNamingConventions: 
Method names should always begin with a lower case character, and should not contain underscores.
          </li>
                            
                                <li> ClassNamingConventions: 
Class names should always begin with an upper case character.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AbstractNaming: 
Abstract classes should be named 'AbstractXXX'.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidDollarSigns: 
Avoid using dollar signs in variable/method/class/interface names.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> MethodWithSameNameAsEnclosingClass: 
Non-constructor methods should not have the same name as the enclosing class.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> SuspiciousHashcodeMethodName: 
The method name and return type are suspiciously close to hashCode(), which
may mean you are intending to override the hashCode() method.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> SuspiciousConstantFieldName: 
A field name is all in uppercase characters, which in Sun's Java naming
conventions indicate a constant. However, the field is not final.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> SuspiciousEqualsMethodName: 
The method name and parameter number are suspiciously close to
equals(Object), which may mean you are intending to override the equals(Object)
method.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidFieldNameMatchingTypeName: 
It is somewhat confusing to have a field name matching the declaring class name.
This probably means that type and or field names could be more precise.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidFieldNameMatchingMethodName: 
It is somewhat confusing to have a field name with the same name as a method.
While this is totally legal, having information (field) and actions (method) is
not clear naming.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> NoPackage: 
Detects when a class or interface does not have a package definition.
    </li>
                            
                                <li> PackageCase: 
    Detects when a package definition contains upper case characters.
        </li>
                            
                                <li> MisleadingVariableName: 
Detects when a non-field has a name starting with 'm_'.  This usually
indicates a field and thus is confusing.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> BooleanGetMethodName: 
Looks for methods named 'getX()' with 'boolean' as the return type. The convention
is to name these methods 'isX()'.
        </li>
