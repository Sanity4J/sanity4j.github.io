<H2>NonStaticInitializer</H2>
A nonstatic initializer block will be called any time a constructor
is invoked (just prior to invoking the constructor).  While this
is a valid language construct, it is rarely used and is confusing.
       </p>
		
		
		    
    			<p>This rule is defined by the following XPath expression:</p>
    			
    			
    <div class="source"><pre>

//Initializer[@Static='false']

                 </pre></div>
  
		    
		    
	    
	    
        
        
        <p>Example:</p>
            
    <div class="source"><pre>
                
   
public class MyClass {
 // this block gets run before any call to a constructor
 {
  System.out.println("I am about to construct myself");
 }
}
   
       
            </pre></div>
