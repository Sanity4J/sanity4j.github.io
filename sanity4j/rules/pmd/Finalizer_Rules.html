                                <li> EmptyFinalizer: 
If the finalize() method is empty, then it does not need to exist.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> FinalizeOnlyCallsSuperFinalize: 
If the finalize() is implemented, it should do something besides just calling
super.finalize().
       </li>
                            
                                <li> FinalizeOverloaded: 
Methods named finalize() should not have parameters.  It is
confusing and probably a bug to overload finalize().  It will
not be called by the VM.
   </li>
                            
                                <li> FinalizeDoesNotCallSuperFinalize: 
If the finalize() is implemented, its last action should be to call super.finalize.
       </li>
                            
                                <li> FinalizeShouldBeProtected: 
If you override finalize(), make it protected.  If you make
 it public, other classes may call it.
      </li>
                            
                                <li> AvoidCallingFinalize: 
Object.finalize() is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines
that there are no more references to the object.
      </li>
