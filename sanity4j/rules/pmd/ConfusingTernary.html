In an "if" expression with an "else" clause, avoid negation in
the test.  For example, rephrase:
if (x != y) diff(); else same();
as:
if (x == y) same(); else diff();
Most "if (x != y)" cases without an "else" are often return
cases, so consistent use of this rule makes the code easier
to read.  Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such
as "does the error case go first?" or "does the common case
go first?".

  return (x != y) ? diff : same;
 }
}
