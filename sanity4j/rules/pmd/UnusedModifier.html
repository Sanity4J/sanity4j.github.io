Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and
 methods are public abstract.
 Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public
 and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static).
 For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context
 are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.

public interface Foo {
 public abstract void bar(); // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler

 public static class Bar {} // public, static ignored
 public static interface Baz {} // ditto
}
public class Bar {
 public static interface Baz {} // static ignored
}
