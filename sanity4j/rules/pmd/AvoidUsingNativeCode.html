<H2>AvoidUsingNativeCode</H2>
As JVM and Java language offer already many help in creating application, it should be
                very rare to have to rely on non-java code. Even though, it is rare to actually have to
                use Java Native Interface (JNI). As the use of JNI make application less portable, and
                harder to maintain, it is not recommended.
