<p>Calling overridable methods during construction poses a risk of invoking methods on an incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to debug. It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call super(). If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method, the subclass may be completely uninstantiable. Note that this includes method calls throughout the control flow graph - i.e., if a constructor Foo() calls a private method bar() that calls a public method buz(), this denotes a problem.</p>
<p>This rule is defined by the following Java class: <a href="../../xref/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/design/ConstructorCallsOverridableMethodRule.html">net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.design.ConstructorCallsOverridableMethodRule</a></p>
<p>Example(s):</p>

<div>
<pre>
  
public class SeniorClass {
  public SeniorClass(){
      toString(); //may throw NullPointerException if overridden
  }
  public String toString(){
    return &quot;IAmSeniorClass&quot;;
  }
}
public class JuniorClass extends SeniorClass {
  private String name;
  public JuniorClass(){
    super(); //Automatic call leads to NullPointerException
    name = &quot;JuniorClass&quot;;
  }
  public String toString(){
    return name.toUpperCase();
  }
}
